# KnowBot — AI-Powered Enterprise Knowledge Assistant

---

## What is KnowBot?

KnowBot is a GenAI-powered enterprise knowledge platform that eliminates the time employees waste searching through scattered internal documents. It lets employees ask natural language questions about company policies, processes, and project documents — and get instant, cited answers.

Built for IT companies, KnowBot combines **RAG-based document intelligence**, **real-time meeting transcription**, and **project-based document management** into a single unified interface.

## How RAG Works

```
User question
    ↓
Load Qdrant retriever (filtered by project_id if selected)
    ↓
Find top 4 most similar chunks
    ↓
Inject chunks + metadata into Gemini prompt
    ↓
Gemini generates cited answer
    ↓
Return answer + source filenames to UI
```

Each document chunk stored in Qdrant carries:
- `metadata.project_id` — which project it belongs to
- `metadata.project_name` — human-readable project name  
- `metadata.source` — original filename
